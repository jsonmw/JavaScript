Blackjack game I created as part of a larger website that I haven't finished. But the game is cool, and was fun learning how to use event handlers at this scale, as well as designing a simple GUI using CSS/html.

Everything works and follows the rules of Blackjack precisely, with the exception of splitting a hands. I need to rewrite a few functions and redesign how the game is resolved to make that work and haven't gotten around to it.
